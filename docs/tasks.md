# BroadcastPlugin Improvement Tasks

This document contains a list of actionable improvement tasks for the BroadcastPlugin project. Each task is designed to enhance the plugin's functionality, maintainability, or user experience.

## Code Structure and Organization

1. [x] Refactor the main plugin class to separate concerns:
   - [x] Create a dedicated MessageManager class to handle message formatting and broadcasting
   - [x] Create a ConfigManager class to handle configuration loading and validation
   - [x] Create a CommandManager class to handle command registration and execution

2. [x] Implement a proper package structure:
   - [x] Create separate packages for managers, commands, and utilities
   - [x] Move classes to their appropriate packages

3. [x] Convert Polish comments to English for better international collaboration

4. [x] Remove placeholder comments (e.g., "// ...")

## Error Handling and Robustness

5. [x] Add null checks and validation for configuration values:
   - [x] Validate interval is greater than zero
   - [x] Check for null or empty messages
   - [x] Handle potential exceptions when parsing configuration

6. [x] Implement proper error handling for the scheduler:
   - [x] Add try-catch blocks around scheduler code
   - [x] Log exceptions properly
   - [x] Ensure the plugin doesn't crash on scheduler errors

7. [x] Add graceful handling for missing permissions:
   - [x] Improve permission error messages
   - [x] Log permission issues for administrators

8. [x] Implement a debug mode for troubleshooting:
   - [x] Add debug logging throughout the code
   - [x] Create a configuration option to enable/disable debug mode

## Performance Optimizations

9. [x] Optimize the URL detection regex pattern:
   - [x] Compile the pattern once at initialization instead of for each message
   - [x] Consider using a more efficient regex pattern

10. [x] Implement message caching:
    - [x] Pre-process and cache formatted messages
    - [x] Only reprocess messages when configuration is reloaded

11. [x] Add performance metrics:
    - [x] Track time spent processing messages
    - [x] Log performance statistics in debug mode

12. [x] Optimize scheduler usage:
    - [x] Consider using BukkitRunnable instead of direct scheduler access
    - [x] Implement proper task cancellation on plugin disable

## Documentation and Comments

13. [x] Add comprehensive JavaDoc comments:
    - [x] Document all classes, methods, and fields
    - [x] Include parameter and return value descriptions
    - [x] Document exceptions that may be thrown

14. [x] Create a user guide:
    - [x] Document installation instructions
    - [x] Explain configuration options
    - [x] Provide examples of common use cases

15. [x] Add inline comments explaining complex logic:
    - [x] Document the URL detection and formatting logic
    - [x] Explain the scheduler implementation

16. [x] Create a developer guide:
    - [x] Document the plugin architecture
    - [x] Provide instructions for extending the plugin
    - [x] Include build and deployment instructions

## Configuration Options

17. [x] Add more customization options:
    - [x] Allow customizing the separator line
    - [x] Add option to enable/disable clickable links
    - [x] Add option to randomize message order

18. [x] Implement configuration validation:
    - [x] Validate all configuration values on load
    - [x] Provide helpful error messages for invalid configurations

19. [x] Add support for multiple configuration files:
    - [x] Allow organizing messages into categories
    - [x] Support different intervals for different message categories

20. [x] Implement hot-reloading of configuration:
    - [x] Detect changes to configuration files
    - [x] Automatically reload without requiring command

## Feature Enhancements

21. [x] Add support for placeholders:
    - [x] Implement variables like {player}, {online_players}, {server_tps}
    - [x] Support integration with PlaceholderAPI if available

22. [x] Implement message targeting:
    - [x] Allow sending messages to specific players or groups
    - [x] Add permission-based message filtering

23. [x] Add message scheduling options:
    - [x] Support time-based scheduling (e.g., only during certain hours)
    - [x] Allow different intervals for different messages

24. [x] Implement interactive messages:
    - [x] Add support for hover events
    - [x] Support for suggestion commands on click
    - [x] Allow running commands on click

25. [x] Add message conditions:
    - [x] Only show messages when certain conditions are met
    - [x] Support for player count conditions, time conditions, etc.

## Deployment and Distribution

30. [x] Prepare for distribution:
    - [x] Create a proper README.md file
    - [x] Add license information
    - [x] Create release notes template
